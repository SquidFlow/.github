# H4-POC Organization

Welcome to H4-POC Organization! ðŸ‘‹

> H4 represents the next iteration, the next possibility, and a new exploration following the H3 system.

## About Us

H4-POC is an experimental project aimed at improving GitOps workflows. As platform usage within organizations evolves from initial developer-centric operations to include team members without extensive ops background, we recognized the need for a more intuitive experience.

Our goal is to enhance the self-service platform experience by:
- Making configuration fields self-explanatory
- Simplifying the GitOps workflow
- Providing better user experience for platform operations

This project serves as a proof of concept for these improvements, primarily developed using Go language.
